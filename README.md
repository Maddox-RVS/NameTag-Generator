# NameTag-Generator

To get started, run the "TagGen.py" file.

1. Place any backgrounds you want to use inside the "Backgrounds" folder. Only works with .png files, other types will not show up as options.

2. Place any fonts you want to use inside the "Fonts" folder. Only works with .ttf files, other types will not show up as options.

3. The "Tag Lists" folder is slightly different. Inside the "Tag Lists" folder, place .txt files containing your list of names, initials, and titles, other types of files will not show up as an option. The .txt files will need to be formatted in a specific way to be read by the program correctly. On each line of the .txt file write the name, initial, and title of each nametag to be created.

    EX.

    Bob,L,Lawyer
    Ted,J,Accountant
    Sarrah,M,Scientist
    Becky,O,Engineer
    Owan,R,Electrical Engineer

    etc..

    NOTE: If you do not want extra spaces beween the name, initial, and title, DO NOT put a space when separating words with commas!
        **DO NOT DO** (to prevent extra spaces on the nametag): Charlie, K, McDonalds Worker <-- The space between "McDonalds" and "Worker" is fine, just DO NOT put spaces next to the commas.

4. Finally, after the nametags have been generated, open the "Ouput" folder to view the result. All generated nametags will be saved to the Output folder.
